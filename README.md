# E-Commerence_Back_End

## Description

### User Story: 
```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
This application is to learn how to use back-end programming by combinding, mysql sequalize and insomnia. This serves as an example to use async requests and api request through servers.
## Installations
node.js, sequalize, mysql

## Usage
### Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
This application will show a demonstration of being able to update mysql databases, call to them in javascript by creating api requests and being able to use insomnia to make the server requests.
